# Potion
A basic disguise plugin based on [Velocity](https://papermc.io/software/velocity). Allow players to change their name to any name they want.

**Note:** This plugin uses reflection to change the player's name, and the name result might affect how other plugins handle players. Use it with caution.

## Command

- `/disguise <name>` - Change your name to `<name>`.
